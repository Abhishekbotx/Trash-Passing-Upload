            The waste management machine features six separate compartments for different types of waste: wet, dry, paper, plastic, e-waste, and sanitary waste. Residents can easily deposit waste into the appropriate color-coded drawer. The machine automatically seals the garbage bags and channels the waste through a tunnel pipe system to a central dumpster in the building for proper disposal and recycling.
